It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.\nAdvantags:\n    1-Scalable. Size is everything, and Flask's status as a microframework means that you can use it to grow a tech project such as a web app incredibly quickly. ...\n    2-Flexible. ...\n    3- Easy to negotiate\n    4-Lightweight. ...\n    5-Documentation. ...\n    6-Not a lot of tools. ...\n    7-Difficult to get familiar with a larger Flask app. ...\n    8-Maintenance costs.\n",
